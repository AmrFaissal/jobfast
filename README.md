jobfast
=======

JobFast is a simple Perl script to automate CV sending. This script allow you to send a "standard" email, which's derived from your personal template, with enclosed files such as your Curriculum Vitae. I guess this approach will help you a lot raising your chances of getting a job, because all what you have to do is to create a template that fits all your applicaions in a simple text file and passed it on to JobFast that sends it along with your Curriculum Vitate.

Steps
-----
1- Create your email template, which is a simple text file (*.txt) and put in a Templates folder (e.g $HOME/Templates)<br/>
2- Put along with your email template, your Curriculum Vitae<br/>
3- Edit the Perl script by changing the server address, port, username and password.<br/>


Enjoy :)
